# disaster-tweet-rnn
Recurrent neural network (RNN) to detect disaster from tweets
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency. The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

In this project, we will build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. The dataset consists of 10,000 labeled tweets. I will use the LSTM technique to train an RNN model.
